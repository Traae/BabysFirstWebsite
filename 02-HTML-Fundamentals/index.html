      stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web
      developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language). HTML consists of elements that describe different
      types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web
      browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites. In HTML, each
      element is made up of 3 parts: The opening tag The closing tag The actual
      element You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.
